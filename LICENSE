_TheProject_ Individual Contributor License
Agreement ("Agreement"), v1.0

You accept and agree to the following terms and
conditions for Your present and future Contributions
submitted to Jason E. Aten, ("_TheProject_"). Except
for the license granted herein to _TheProject_ and
recipients of software distributed by _TheProject_,
You reserve all right, title, and interest in and
to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or
legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that
is making this Agreement with _TheProject_. For
legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and
all other entities that control, are controlled by,
or are under common control with that entity are
considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes
of this definition, "control" means (i) the power,
direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise,
or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of
the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of
authorship, including any modifications or additions
to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted
by You to _TheProject_ for inclusion in, or
documentation of, any of the products owned or
managed by _TheProject_ (the "Work"). For the
purposes of this definition, "submitted" means
any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
sent to _TheProject_ or its representatives, including
but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking
systems that are managed by, or on behalf of,
_TheProject_ for the purpose of discussing and
improving the Work, but excluding communication
that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated
in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
_TheProject_ and to recipients of software distributed
by _TheProject_ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
_TheProject_ and to recipients of software distributed
by _TheProject_ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes
patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which
you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
to that entity under this Agreement for that
Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant
the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to
intellectual property that you create that includes your
Contributions, you represent that you have received
permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer,
that your employer has waived such rights for your
Contributions to _TheProject_, or that your employer
has executed a separate Corporate CLA with _TheProject_.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is
Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions
on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution
submissions include complete details of any third-party
license or other restriction (including, but not limited
to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are
personally aware and which are associated with any
part of Your Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your
Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide
support. You may provide support for free, for a fee,
or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions
on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
without limitation, any warranties or conditions of
TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your
original creation, You may submit it to _TheProject_
separately from any Contribution, identifying the
complete details of its source and of any license or
other restriction (including, but not limited to,
related patents, trademarks, and license agreements)
of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously
marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a 
third-party: [named here]".

8. You agree to notify _TheProject_ of any facts or
circumstances of which you become aware that would
make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
